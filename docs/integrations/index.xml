The original author left the project and the remaining development team doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a Roon setup. We are trying to keep the current plugin running as long as the YIO integration API permits, but things will most likely break in the future. There will be no new features or fixes.
Please contact us on GitHub, YIO forum or Discord if you&amp;rsquo;d like to help out!</description></item><item><title>Spotify</title><link>https://yio-remote.github.io/documentation/docs/integrations/spotify/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yio-remote.github.io/documentation/docs/integrations/spotify/</guid><description>Spotify integration YIO directly supports Spotify so you will be able to stream your music to all Spotify Connect enabled devices.
